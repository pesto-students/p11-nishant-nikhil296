                Arguably, snake season is year-round in Arizona, a state known for
                its rattlers.<br/> But baby rattlesnakes are born in July and August, making these 
                two months<br/>especially dangerous for hikers, gardeners, children and others at 
                high risk of exposure<br/>to rattlesnake bites.

                So far this year, 74 rattlesnake bites to humans have been reported to the <br>
                Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center. Based at the University of Arizona <br>
                College of Pharmacy, the center serves the entire state of Arizona with the <br>
                exception of Maricopa County, providing free and confidential poison and <br>
                medication information to callers around the clock.

                Specialists answering the phones at the center regularly receive calls from <br>
                Arizonans of all ages who don't realize they were bitten by a rattler. The poison <br>
                center urges anyone who feels a mysterious sting, pinch or bite while outdoors to <br>
                immediately call the center at 800-222-1222.

                "We will ask a few questions that will help you either identify possible snakebite <br>
                or eliminate it," said Keith Boesen, director of the Arizona Poison and Drug <br>
                Information Center. "With snakebite, the sooner the medical treatment, the better <br>
                the outcome, so calling us right away can make a very big difference for the <br>
                victims and the medical teams treating them."

                The center advises anyone who might come cross paths with rattlesnakes to be
                aware of these five things:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Baby rattlesnakes range in length from 6 to 12 inches and are easily
                    camouflaged by <br> brush and grass.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Baby rattlesnakes are rattleless until they first shed their skins, so there will be no <br>
                    infamous "chica-chica" sound before they strike.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Despite their impish size, baby snakes have enough venom to be very dangerous <br>
                    if they bite a human.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Adult rattlesnakes do not always rattle an audible warning before or while they <br>
                    are biting.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It's a good idea to call the poison center if you notice an unidentified small <br> cut or
                    wound, even if you feel no pain. With the lack of telltale rattle warning, people <br>
                    can be bitten without knowing what has happened until they notice their <br>
                    symptoms and attribute them to a snakebite.
                </li>
            </ol>
